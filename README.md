# network-traffic-analysis
This project seeks to apply machine learning to network traffic classification.

# The Problem
Security Operation Centers currently spend their time analyzing countless events that are just noise across the network, and are wasting valuable time that could be spent improving network security or analyzing real malicious traffic.
Information Security Teams lack the budget to invest in huge software packages that solve this problem for them. This includes packages that use AI to solve this problem, everything is too expensive relative to their budgets.

# The Idea
Create a ML model that can predict whether a network traffic event is malicious or benign. Utilize current threat feeds to stay up to date and store a database of these recent file hashes and blacklists to do even better analysis. **Please feel free to add your opinions on best features to use in the ML Model Requirements for Accurate Network Traffic.txt File **<br><br>

# The Goal
To reduce the number of events that are just traffic noise coming through the main channel and make the job of a Security Analyst more focused on real malicious traffic as well as improving network security. 

# Possible Factors for ML Model
 Request URL, Destination Address, Device Severity, CategoryOutcome, CategoryBehavior, and more.
